1. Search for your own name. Are there both boys and girls that have
   your name? Is it more popular for one group than for the other?
   
2. Are there more boys names or girls names? What about for particular
   letters?  What about for every letter?
   
3. What is the longest name in the dataset?
   
4. What is the most common name and how often does it occur?
   
5. What is the least common name and how often does it occur? Does
   that concern you?
   
6. How many boys and girls are described in the dataset (i.e., how
   many boys and girls born in 2013 have names given to at least four
   others)?
   
7. How many boys names are also girls names? How many girls names are
   also boys names?
   
8. How many names are subsets of other names?
   
9. What is the most popular girls name that is also a boys name?

10. Take a prefix as input and print the number of boys and girls with
    that prefix. (i.e., "m" would list babies whose names start with
    "m" and "ma" would list babies whose names start with "ma", etc).
